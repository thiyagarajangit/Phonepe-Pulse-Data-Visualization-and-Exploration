 **Problem Statement:** 
  The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to
various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain
insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.

**Solution:**
* Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as JSON. Looping through each and every folder and opening the json files appending only the required key and values and creating the dataframe. 
*	JSON files that are available in the respective data folder and  converted into the readable and understandable DataFrame format by using the for loop and iterating file by file and then finally the DataFrame is created. 
* In order to perform this step I've used **os**, **json** and **pandas** packages and  insert the  DataFrame into DB.

**Soution Steps:**
   * Data Extraction
   * Creating Tables
   * Data Transformation
   * Database Insertion
   * Data Retrieval
   * Dashboard Creation
     
**Dashboard Components:**
   * Transaction Analysis
   * User Based Analysis
   * Statewise Analysis
   * Map Visulization
     
**Technologies:**
   * Github Cloning
   * Python
   * Pandas
   * MySQL
   * Streamlit
   * Plotly
     
**Results:**
